                                <h3>Early Years & Discovery</h3>
                                <p>My journey into tech began when I was just 6 years old. I got my first laptop—an
                                    extremely old, used one passed down from a neighbor. Despite its age, it felt like a
                                    treasure chest. I spent hours messing around with CDs and DVDs, copying music from
                                    discs to the laptop, and just exploring what I could do. That curiosity became the
                                    spark.</p>

                                <p>One day, I came home from primary school and found that my brother had taken off
                                    every single key from the keyboard and collected them in a bowl. I was furious—but
                                    it also made me realize how much I cared about that machine. That moment stayed with
                                    me. It was more than just frustration; it was the beginning of my passion for
                                    computers and building things.</p>

                                <p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Curiosity and hands-on experience drive real
                                    learning. Sometimes, a broken keyboard is what shows you just how much something
                                    matters to you.</p>

                                <p>During high school, I started developing my first real applications—simple apps and
                                    utilities for friends. This was when I realized programming could be more than just
                                    a hobby.</p>

                                <p>It was also the time I became more responsible with money. Not all of it went to
                                    sweets and chocolates anymore. I started investing in hardware—buying SSDs, RAM, and
                                    tools that allowed me to experiment. I watched endless YouTube videos and quickly
                                    discovered that things I once thought were only possible for professionals with
                                    massive setups and big budgets were actually achievable at home. You could build
                                    mini versions of those same “impossible” things yourself.</p>

                                <p>From swapping my first HDD to an SSD and witnessing the instant speed boost, to
                                    learning how software and hardware come together, every bit of money and time
                                    started going into something that pushed me deeper into the world of technology. The
                                    spark was growing—and it was starting to look like a path, not just a passion.</p>

                                <p>My university years were transformative, both academically and professionally. It’s
                                    where I first learned web development—and everything changed from there. I was
                                    introduced to automation, IoT, and building systems that brought real convenience
                                    and intelligence into everyday tasks. This was the point where my curiosity evolved
                                    into innovation.</p>

                                <p>At different points in my life, I always thought my latest project was my best work.
                                    But as I progressed through university, each new challenge pushed me further, and
                                    every project showed massive improvement over the last. College didn’t just teach me
                                    tech skills—it gave me a new kind of spark. It made me realize the potential I had,
                                    and that with the right mindset, tools, and drive, I could build almost anything.

                                <p>Entering the professional world was both exciting and humbling. Although my formal
                                    career timeline begins in 2025, I was already employed in 2024 as part of a college
                                    requirement. Stepping into the workplace for the first time took everything to a
                                    whole new level. In college, I felt ready for anything—until I was asked to complete
                                    tasks I had never encountered before. I quickly realized that knowing how to learn
                                    was more valuable than knowing everything.</p>

                                <p>This is where I learned one of my most important lessons: "No" is never an answer.
                                    When I was introduced to APIs and saw the power of system integration for the first
                                    time, it completely shifted my perspective. I began to understand the scale and
                                    potential of real-world applications.</p>

                                <p>Fast forward to 2025: I've successfully built an Online Protection Order Application
                                    System, a full-scale Dispatch & Response platform, CRMs, internal organizational
                                    Intranets, portals, and full-featured E-Commerce websites. And this is just the
                                    beginning. I'm now also venturing into networking and experimenting with AI models
                                    to expand the boundaries of what I can create.</p>

                                    will open doors—but it’s adaptability, problem-solving, and the drive to never stop
                                    learning that push you through them.</p>

                <h4>My Hardware Journey</h4>
                <p>Since childhood, I've been fascinated by hardware - from rebuilding my first PC at 12 to
                    professionally deploying enterprise networking equipment. What began with taking apart old
                    electronics evolved into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Converting dozens of HDD systems to SSDs for performance gains</li>
                    <li>Installing and configuring Cisco switches for corporate networks</li>
                    <li>Modding cases and building custom water-cooled rigs</li>
                    <li>Repairing electronics at component level with precision soldering</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This hands-on experience gives me unique insight into full-stack system design - from silicon to
                    software.</p>
